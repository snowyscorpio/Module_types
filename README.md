# Module Types

This repository contains a solution to a file copying exercise:

## Exercise: Copy Content from Multiple Files
Write a program that defines the names of 10 input files (names in an array) and copies their content into a new file as follows:

1. One line from the first file
2. Two lines from the second file
3. Three lines from the third file
4. And so on...

If a file contains fewer lines than required, the missing lines will not be copied.

The solution is included in a folder named "moduleTypes".


The txt files are located in a folder named "text".
