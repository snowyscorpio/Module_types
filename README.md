# Module Types

This repository contains a solution to a file copying exercise:

## Exercise: Copy Content from Multiple Files
Write a program that defines the names of 10 input files (names in an array) and copies their content into a new file as follows:

- One line from the first file
- Two lines from the second file
- Three lines from the third file
- And so on...

If a file contains fewer lines than required, the missing lines will not be copied.

> The solution is included in a folder named "moduleTypes".


> The txt files are located in a folder named "text", in a folder named "moduleTypes".

> Don't forget to use `npm install`
